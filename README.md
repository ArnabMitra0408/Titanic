# Titanic
In this, classification was done on titanic dataset from kaggle to predict the survival of passengers. The classification algorithms used are Knn,Logistic Regression and Decison trees. Both these algorithms were implemented from scratch and the accuracy obtained were compared with that of sklearn classifier.

| Classifier      | Accuracy From Scratch | Accuracy From Sklearn     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| KNN      | 66.5      | 67.2   |
| Logistic Regression   | 89.95        | 94.01      |
| Decision Trees   | 85.6        | 95.6      |
